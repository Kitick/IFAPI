# Welcome to Flight Sim Copilot!

To get started, download the latest release from the releases folder.

Ensure:
- You have the Infinite Flight Connect setting checked on in the game settings.
- Both devices are connected to the same network.

- If using an IP address, ensure it is the private address. (i.e. starting in 192.168)
- If you are on Mac, you need to run this directly with node. Check those instructions below.

- Using this with VPNs is untested.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
- Extract the folder to wherever you like. If you are updating, delete the old folder first.
- Open The folder and double click on the shortcut for the exe. Feel free to move this shortcut whever you like.
- Allow private connections if windows firewall blocks it initally.
- Load into a flight on infinite flight, then hit connect. You can also directly enter your ip if known.

Feel free to report any issues here on github or dm them to me on discord at Kitick.
If you have any questions about the app or how to use it reach out to me on discord.

IF YOU WANT TO RUN USING NODE
- Dowload node.js: https://nodejs.org/en | You do not need to install anything else but Node itself.
- Download the code by clicking the green CODE button, and download zip.
- Follow The USAGE INSTRUCTIONS above, except instead of the shortcut, double click start.bat OR run "electron ." in the terminal from the api folder.
